# EEG-ANALYSIS-FOR-MOTOR-IMAGERY-APPLICATION
In this project I have implemented two different feature extraction techniques for EEG classificatio- Common Spatial Pattern and Discrete Wavelet Transforms.
The success of machine learning algorithms is considerably dependent on the features provided to them. I have implemented these techniques to observe the differences in classification accuracy as one changes the features. I have also implemented an additional feature extraction technique which is a modification of the
